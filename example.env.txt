mongo_token=paste you token here


No need to have all these step in ur orignal .env file. Also never push env to this repository.

Step 1- Make a file with named .env (Yeah, its case sensitive).
Step 2- Have a key named mongo_token and the value is provided only to this repo maintainers.
Step 3- save. Again never push this file to the main repository,

Note- Dont rename the key name above ie, it should be mongo_token only.
